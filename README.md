# Play-Battlesnake-in-Discord
A discord bot built using [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and run in [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) that allows the user to play [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) with their friends in Discord chat.

This project was originally inspired by an idea given by a fellow user in the [Battlesnake Discord](https://play.battlesnake.com/discord/) community. 

Currently, only a single snake plays in the game and all user interaction is via keyboard control. Any user can control the snake on the board at any given time during the game.

You can play it [here](https://discord.gg/ANseruUyWX).

## Commands
Game is played using the following chat commands to control the snake.

**$start** or **$play** - start a new game
**$end** - force-stop a game in progress

**$up**, **$down**, **$left**, or **$right**: move the snake up, down, left, or right, respectively.
